Heicoders Academy (Professionals) Singapore, AI200 Applied Machine Learning Capstone Project 
The capstone project incorporates the building of a classification model to predict whether an online auction bid is made by a human or a robot using a series of datasets.
Train and Test datasets are uploaded into the Data folder, while the Bids dataset can be obtained from the original Kaggle competition webpage due to its file size exceeding the maximum size limit: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/data
